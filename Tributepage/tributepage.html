                Bill Gates, in full William Henry Gates III, (born Oct. 28, 1955, Seattle, Washington, U.S.), U.S. computer programmer and businessman.
                 As a teenager, he helped computerize his high school’s payroll system and founded a company that sold traffic-counting systems to
                  local governments. At 19 he dropped out of Harvard University and cofounded Microsoft Corp. with Paul G. Allen. Microsoft began 
                  its domination of the fledgling microcomputer industry when Gates licensed the operating system MS-DOS to IBM in 1980 for use 
                  in IBM’s first personal computer.As Microsoft’s largest shareholder, Gates became a billionaire in 1986, and within a decade 
                  he was the world’s richest private individual. Beginning in 1995, he refocused Microsoft on the development of software solutions 
                  for the Internet, and he also moved the company into the computer hardware and gaming markets with the Xbox video machine. 
                  In 1999 he and his wife created the largest charitable foundation in the U.S. In 2008 Gates relinquished day-to-day oversight 
                  of Microsoft in order to devote more time to charity work. He remained, however, the company’s chairman until 2014.</p>

                <p>Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William Henry Gates Sr. and
                     Mary Maxwell Gates. His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish. His father was a prominent lawyer, 
                     and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way of America. 
                     Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has an elder sister Kristi (Kristianne) 
                     and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" 
                      because his father had the "II" suffix. The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged 
                      by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.</p>
                <p>
                    Early in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career. When he was young, his family regularly attended
                     a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination. Gates was small for his age and was bullied
                      as a child. The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or 
                      swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".

                <P>Gates is an avid reader,and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.
                     He also enjoys bridge, tennis and golf. Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates flew coach in commercial aircraft 
                     until 1997, when he bought a private jet. Gates purchased the Codex Leicester, a collection of scientific writings by Leonardo da Vinci. 
                     In 1998, he reportedly paid $30 million for the original 1885 maritime painting Lost on the
                       Grand Banks, at the time a record price for an American painting.In 2016, he revealed that he was color-blind.</P>
                <p>
                    Gates married Melinda French on the Hawaiian Island of Lanai on January 1, 1994. They met in 1987 after Melinda began working at Microsoft.
                     Bill and Melinda have three children: Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe. The family's residence is an earth-sheltered mansion in the side 
                    of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina, Washington. In 2009, property taxes on the mansion were reported to be US$1.063 million,
                     on a total assessed value of US$147.5 million. The 66,000 sq.ft estate has a 60 ft swimming pool with 
                     an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500-square-foot gym and a 1,000-square-foot dining room. On May 3, 2021, 
                     the Gateses announced they had decided to divorce after 27 years of marriage and 34 years as a couple. They said they would keep working 
                     together on charitable efforts. 
                     The divorce was finalized on August 2, 2021.

                    At 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school, where he wrote his first software program. When he was in the eighth grade,
                     the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of 
                     computer time on a General Electric computer for the students. Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC.
                      He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe
                      that allowed users to play games against the computer. 
                       After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these
                       systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and
                        first business partner Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.
                </p>

                <p>       
                    The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money. At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software 
                    in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using the system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code
                    for various programs that ran on the system, including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970. 
                    The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling 
                    system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year.
                    Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside.

                <p>
                    At 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor. He was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.
                     He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973. He chose 
                    a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses. While at Harvard, he met
                     Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as 
                    Microsoft's CEO and maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution
                     to one of a series problems presented in a combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis. His solution held the record as the
                      fastest version for over 30 years. His solution was formalized and published in collaboration
                       with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou. In 1975, the MITS Altair 8800 was released based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw the opportunity to start their 
                        own computer software company. Gates dropped out of Harvard that same year. His parents were supportive of him after seeing how much 
                        he wanted to start his own company. He explained his decision to leave Harvard: "if things hadn't worked out, I could always go back 
                        to school. I was officially on leave."

                <P>
                    Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the "William H. Gates 
                    Foundation". In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable Bill
                     & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets
                      reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion. The foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being 
                      spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust. Gates, through his foundation, also donated $20 million 
                      to Carnegie Mellon University for a new building to be named Gates Center for Computer Science which opened in 2009. Gates has credited
                      the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times,
                       and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global
                        problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous 
                        hilanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity, the couple plan to eventually donate 95% of their wealth to charity.

                    The foundation is organized into five program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy 
                    & Advocacy Division. Among others, it supports a wide range of public health projects, granting aid to fight transmissible diseases such AIDS, 
                    tuberculosis and malaria, as well as widespread vaccine programs to eradicate polio. It grants funds to learning institutes and libraries and 
                    supports scholarships at universities. The foundation established a water, sanitation and hygiene program to provide sustainable sanitation services 
                    in poor countries. Its agriculture division supports the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified
                     rice variant used to combat vitamin A deficiency. The goal of the foundation is to provide 120 million women and girls, in the poorest countries
                     , with high-quality contraceptive information and services, with the longer-term goal of universal access to voluntary family planning. In 2007, 
                     the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, pollution and 
                     pharmaceutical firms that do not sell to developing countries. Although the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social 
                     responsibility, it was subsequently canceled and upheld its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence
                      company practices. Gates in a fireside chat moderated by Shereen Bhan virtually at the Singapore FinTech Festival 2020. Gates delivered 
                    his thoughts in a fireside chat moderated by journalist and news anchor Shereen Bhan virtually at the Singapore FinTech Festival on December 8, 2020,
                       on the topic, "Building Infrastructure for Resilience: What the COVID-19 Response Can Teach Us About How to Scale Financial Inclusion".
